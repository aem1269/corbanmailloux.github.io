                    I'm Corban Mailloux. Nice to "meet" you. I'm a student at Rochester Institute of Technology in Rochester, NY pursuing a BS in Software Engineering. Currently, I work as a developer at <a href="http://mobiusworks.com/" target="_blank">Mobius Works</a> in Westfield, MA, developing custom software and also customizations to an <abbr title="Enterprise Resource Planning">ERP</abbr> system called <a href="http://www.epicor.com/" target="_blank">Epicor</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I originally set up this site to play with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>, but as I added to it, I decided that I would make it my main website.

                    I chose the domain corb.co for two reasons:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I wanted a simple, short URL that I could use for everything.</li>
                    <li>I wanted to limit people spelling my name incorrectly. (You may have noticed; my name is spelled "Corban," not "Corbin.")</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    I can be contacted by using any of those pretty buttons at the top of the page.
