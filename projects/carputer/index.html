            CarPuter is a project to take my base-model car and add features I want to it. I'll be adding:
            <ul class="fa-ul">
                <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o"></i>Power windows. <small class="text-info">Installed!</small></li>
                <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o"></i>Power locks. <small class="text-info">Installed!</small></li>
                <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o"></i>Key-less entry. <small class="text-info">Installed!</small></li>
                <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-check-square-o"></i>A powered subwoofer in the back. <small class="text-info">Installed!</small></li>
                <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square-o"></i>LED interior lighting.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square-o"></i>A tablet-based center console that allows interaction with all of the added features.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-square-o"></i>An OBD-II connection to display real-time car engine information.</li>
                <li><i class="fa-li fa fa-spinner fa-spin"></i>Likely much more, over time...</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            This project grew out of a fascination with the low level of technology in cars. We've finally hit a point where cars have advanced computers, but it's still a significant luxury, even though the cost of the actual devices is rapidly declining. A good example of a modern, fully integrated system is the <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/models/features#/interior" target="_blank">Tesla Model S' 17" touchscreen</a>. They integrate all of the systems of the car into a massive tablet, essentially. There are talks, as of right now, of adding an Android emulator to the system, so it can run Android apps. Pretty cool, if I do say so myself.
            <br>
            My goal is to build something <i>similar</i> to that. Certainly not quite on that level of awesome, but I guess we'll see how it ends up.
            <br><br>
            The original plan was to use my old Dell Mini 9 netbook to act as the central system. I started planning out and even building some software for the netbook, but ended up frustrated with the speed of the machine and the lack of good Windows GPS tools. I may, however, end up back on a Windows- or Linux-based laptop as the central machine of the system, depending on how everything works out.
            <br>
            I plan to use an Android tablet as the new center of the system. For now, I'll be using Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, but I plan to buy a smaller, cheaper tablet to fully install into the car's dash. The tablet will interact with the other systems through a homemade Android app and the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11343" target="_blank">IOIO development board</a>. The IO pins will connect to the new electric windows and locks, and possibly, control the basic climate control system, replacing the old manual system.

            First, a demonstration:

            For the hardware end of things, I used a breadboard-able version of an Arduino. Any Arduino or Arduino clone should work.
            <br>

            Essentially, the Arduino receives bytes from the Serial Module through digital pin 2 and sends data through digital pin 3. The power N-channel MOSFETS have their gate legs (left legs) connected to PWM pins 9, 10, and 11. Each gate leg is also connected through a resistor to GND. The drain leg (middle leg) is connected to one of the negative returns from the LED strip. The source legs (right leg) are all connected to GND.
            <br>
            The 12 volt power source connects to GND and the common anode on the LED strip.
            <br><br>

            The Android app was written using MIT's App Inventor. The project source and a compiled APK version of the app are available on <a href="https://github.com/corbanmailloux/RGBDuino" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.
            <br><br>
            The Arduino side of the project uses the SoftwareSerial Library to listen to the Bluetooth module. This could be done with the built in Serial pins, but that would make it difficult to upload new code while testing.
            <br>
            It looks like this (and is also on <a href="https://github.com/corbanmailloux/RGBDuino" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>):
