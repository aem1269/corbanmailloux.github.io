                    MediaList is the love-child of <a href="/projects/tvlist">TVList</a> and <a href="/projects/movielist">MovieList</a>. It is a simple C# movie and TV show listing application, specifically for collections spanning multiple drives or folders.
                    <br>
                    It does this by quickly scanning through user-defined sets of directories, indexing files and folders inside, and creating sorted, searchable lists of movies and TV shows.
                    <br>
                    It features real-time searching and the ability to open a selection in Windows Explorer.
                    <br><br>
                    The code, and a compiled EXE file, are available on <a href="https://github.com/corbanmailloux/MediaList" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.
                    <br>
