                <h4>Update</h4>
                I rebuilt this entire app in C# (WPF) in one night, because I was bored. I then realized how much I like C#, and decided that I'll continue working on that version and leave the Java version to die for now. 
                <br>
                Both versions, at the moment, are available on <a href="https://github.com/corbanmailloux/MovieList" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>, but I might rebuild TVList in C# too, and combine them into one nice media manager. I'll keep you posted.

                    MovieList is a simple Java 1.7 media manager for movie collections that span multiple drives or folders.
                    <br>
                    MovieList allows a user to quickly search through a large movie collection that may span multiple drives or folders. It does this by quickly looking through each folder given to it, indexing the files, and keeping an organized list of all of the movies found. 
                    <br>
                    It also features real-time searching, a duplicate listing mode, and the ability to open a movie in Windows Explorer.
                    <br><br>
                    The code, and a compiled JAR file, are available on <a href="https://github.com/corbanmailloux/MovieList" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.
