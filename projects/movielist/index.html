                MovieList is a simple Java 1.7 media manager for movie collections that span multiple drives or folders.
                <br>
                MovieList allows a user to quickly search through a large movie collection that may span multiple drives or folders. It does this by quickly looking through each folder given to it, indexing the files, and keeping an organized list of all of the movies found. 
                <br>
                It also features real-time searching, a duplicate listing mode, and the ability to open a movie in Windows Explorer.
                <br><br>
                The code, and a compiled JAR file, are available on <a href="https://github.com/corbanmailloux/MovieList" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
