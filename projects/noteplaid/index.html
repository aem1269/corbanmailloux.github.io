                    Noteplaid is a text editor that has a plaid background. It is essentially a Windows Notepad clone <small>(<i>please don't sue me</i>)</small> built using WPF in C#. 
                    <br><br>
                    One day, I was talking to <a href="https://github.com/aem1269" target="_blank">Adam McCarthy</a> and I stuttered when saying "Notepad." Thus, the concept for Noteplaid was born. I made a GUI mockup that day, and then the project lay dormant for almost 3 months.

                    <i>And then it was finals week...</i>
                    <br>
                    The first version was built because I was procrastinating studying for a final.
                    <br><br>
                    The code, and a compiled EXE file, are available on Adam's <a href="https://github.com/aem1269/Noteplaid" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>.
