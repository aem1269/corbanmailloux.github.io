        <p>
            In one of my classes, we are using <a href="http://spinroot.com/spin/whatispin.html" target="_blank">Spin</a>, and specifically <a href="https://code.google.com/p/jspin/" target="_blank">jSpin</a> to do some software modeling. Like I mentioned in my <a href="/projects/sublime-mit-alloy" target="_blank">Sublime-MIT-Alloy</a> project, I use Sublime Text 3 as my day-to-day editing, so I was disappointed when there was no highlighting available for Promela (the language of Spin). I found a VIM highlighter, so I manually converted that to a Sublime syntax file.
            <br><br>
            Once that was working, I got annoyed with switching to jSpin to test my code, so I built a build system. The build process is basic, and it only handles the "Random" mode of Spin, but it was enough for me.
            <br><br>
            The project is available on <a href="https://github.com/corbanmailloux/sublime-promela-spin" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github"></i> GitHub</a>, with an installation guide.
